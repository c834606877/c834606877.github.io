<blockquote><strong>1. Make sure your current system is up-to-date and backed up</strong></p>
<p>First up, ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of Fedora 21 by updating your system using the Software application, or running the following command in the terminal:</p>
<pre>sudo dnf update</pre>
<p><strong>2. Install the FedUp tool</strong></p>
<p>Now, open up a Terminal and install FedUp package by using the following command line:</p>
<pre>sudo dnf install fedup</pre>
<p><strong>3. Start the update with FedUp</strong></p>
<p>Now your system is fully up-to-date, start the upgrade using the following command:</p>
<pre>sudo fedup --network 22</pre>
<p>This command will tell FedUp to download all the appropriate packages from the Fedora repositories, and prep your system for the upgrade.<br />
<strong>4. Reboot, and upgrade</strong></p>
<p>Once the FedUp command from step 3 has completed without errors, reboot your system. In the Fedora Boot Menu (i.e. grub), there will be a menu item “System Upgrade”, select that and press enter.<br />
Boot menu with System Upgrade (fedup) option selected<br />
<code class="prettyprint">Boot menu with update option selected</code></p>
<p>All the appropriate packages and upgrade tasks will now be completed automatically, and when completed you will be able to start using your newly upgraded Fedora system.</p></blockquote>
