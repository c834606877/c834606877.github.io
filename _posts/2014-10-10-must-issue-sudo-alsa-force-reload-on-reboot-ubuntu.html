<p>
	I have a problem, I have got sound working...</p>
<p>
	But only when I issue the Code:</p>
<pre>
sudo alsa force-reload</pre>
<p>
	It will when play the sound that was queued to play, like the login sound.</p>
<p>
	Everytime when I restart, I have to do Code:</p>
<pre>
sudo alsa force-reload </pre>
<p>
	in order for sound to work.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Solution :</p>
<pre>
	sudo gedit /etc/default/acpi-support
	# Add modules to this list to have them removed before suspend and reloaded<br />
	# on resume. An example would be MODULES=&quot;em8300 yenta_socket&quot;<br />
	#<br />
	# Note that network cards and USB controllers will automatically be unloaded<br />
	# unless they&#39;re listed in MODULES_WHITELIST<br />
	MODULES=&quot;soundcore&quot;
</pre>
